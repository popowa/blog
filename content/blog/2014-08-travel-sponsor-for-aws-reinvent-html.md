I recently knew the meaning of cognito.



I made a pitch at JAWS-UG LT , AWS Summit 2014. I would like to call for
travel sponsor for AWS re:Invent.

### Passion

I have been using AWS since 2009 and more than 5 years, I have been
expanding technical understanding of AWS and do community activity
including JAWSUG.  
I was selected as AWS Samurai 2014, and I\'m also core member of [JAWSUG
Fukuoka](http://jaws-ug.jp/bc/fukuoka/) and
[Cloudgirl](http://cloudgirls.blogspot.jp/).  
I work for Serverwork Co., Ltd. and my job is helping customers who want
to use AWS.  
re:Invent is the must event for people who is in cloud industry. So I
will try travel sponsor for re:Invent.  
I will give everything that I learn from re:Invent back to community and
cloud industry including Japan.
